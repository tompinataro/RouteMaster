# Sprint 2 — Navigation Polish (2h)

- Goal: Finalize JS stack navigation; consistent headers; iOS/Web parity.
- Tasks:
  - Confirm headers, back glyph, and title sizing on all screens.
  - Ensure custom headerLeft works with accessibility and hit areas.
  - Remove any lingering native-stack references.
- Acceptance:
  - Back/from Visit → RouteList works cleanly with correct layout.
  - No visual regressions on web (8081) and iOS simulator.
- Dependencies: Sprint 1
- Status: DONE — header/back polish with accessible labels and parity
